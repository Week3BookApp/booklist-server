# booklist-client
Book App - clientside repo

Steve Starwalt
**Version**: 1.0.3

## Overview
As a developer, I want to separate the Client UI from the backend API so that my project is thoughtfully organized.
As a user, I want to host my app on a reliable, scalable application hosting service so that I can access my mobile app when I'm on the go and share it with others.
I want to display all of my books at once so that I can see everything in a single view.
I want my books to be rendered dynamically so that I can view all of the books in my list.
I want a view which displays any error messages that occur during the usage of my book list application.
I want a simple, clean looking UI so that my application is easy to navigate.

As a developer, I want to deploy the backend API to a hosting service so that other developers may build their own frontend interfaces for this application.
I want to seed my local development database with books so I have data to test my development application with.
I want the client application to have access to a deployed PostgreSQL database so the user data persists across application sessions.


## Getting Started
Start by setting up a pair of repos in GitHub, one for the client side, one for the server side.  Add an index.html file to the client side repo so you can deploy the page on Github.  Set up a new database in Heroku and link that to your repos in Github. Set up a server.js file in the server repo and link that to the heroku database and the .js client side files.  Build your database in your own postgresql database then push that data to heroku.


## Credits and Collaborations
Got a lot of help from all the TAs and Allie.  Some of the code is from Kevin Farrow. Used Icomoon.io for the icons.  Used stackoverflow, mdn and W3 websirtes for the hamburger menu.  As you can tell, used no one for the CSS!
